# Create github repository 

Set up a private git repository, locally and remotely, and connect the two. 

## Usage
In a terminal window:
```bash
create_git.sh <repo_name>
```

This creates a folder in your current directory.

Requires *pygithub* to access remote repository. Add your github token and username to the *create_git.py* and *create_git.sh* files where indicated. Make sure to set the absolute path to the python script in the shell script.
